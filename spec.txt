Objective: Beacons are scattered around a field. At each beacon, a color wheel must be rotated to a color as defined by a signal on/from the beacon.

Robot Setup: wheeled differential drive robot (ROMI base), with a beacon sensor and a color wheel manipulator (complete with sensor)

This will be an excercise to get used to the command structure provided by WPILib - don't worry too much about the implementation of the subsystems themselves.
See https://docs.wpilib.org for docs

Details:
Beacons:
    - transmit a unique ID and the required color
    - always transmit, even after their color wheel has been matched.
    - do not disclose if their color wheel has been matched or not
