Objective: Beacons are scattered around a field. At each beacon, a color wheel must be rotated to a color as defined by a signal on/from the beacon.

Robot Setup: wheeled differential drive robot (ROMI base), with a beacon sensor and a color wheel manipulator (complete with sensor)

This will be an excercise to get used to the command structure provided by WPILib - don't worry too much about the implementation of the subsystems themselves.
